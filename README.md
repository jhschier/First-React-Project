This project is a user information management web application built with React. It provides a platform for users to input their name and age, and upon submission, the user's data is displayed as labels. The app serves as an excellent exercise to hone your React skills while incorporating package management using Yarn or npm, styled-components for CSS styling, JSX for mixing HTML and JavaScript, and React Hooks, including useState and useRef.

Project Features:

User Input: Users can enter their name and age into separate input fields.

User Data Display: Upon confirmation, the user's information, including their name and age, is rendered as labels on the screen.

User Deletion: The app allows users to remove entries from the list, giving them control over their displayed data.

Styled User Interface: styled-components is employed to style the application, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Technology Stack:

React: The front-end framework for building the user interface.
Yarn or npm: Package managers for managing project dependencies.
styled-components: A CSS-in-JS library for styling the application.
JSX: Utilized to create components and merge HTML with JavaScript in a React application.
React Hooks: Specifically, useState for managing the application's state and useRef for accessing DOM elements.
